## :star2: About the Project
This is a general overview of how one would perform search queries on a large databas using the SQL syntax. Using the latest version
of MySQL Workbench, included there are two SQL script files with both containing some specific search query requests with the 
included answers to each search request. This is a good resource for anyone trying to leanr SQL for the first time or even seasoned folks who just need a refreshere on how
the language is written. Feel free to use these files however you want, just know that the database used is a fictional Best Buy database and 
does not reflect actual specific data as prescribed to Best Buy in the real world. Merely a practice exercise template for learning purposes only. 
## :toolbox: Getting Started
Below you will see how to get up and running using these scripts. Enjoy!
### :bangbang: Prerequisites

- MySQL Workbench @Latest
- download the latest version of MySQL Workbench and install
- once installed you can point the workbench to open these two script files
- PLEASE NOTE- You would need the sample database to view the returned values inside of workbench which at this time
- I'm not entirely sure that I can provide at this moment. I will reach out to the people the database belongs to and
- if granted the permission to post the database to this github repo I will do so. So please check back frequently if
- you in fact need or want the database, as I will update this file with a response. (Today's Date 05/08/2024)
